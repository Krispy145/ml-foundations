# ML Foundations

Hands-on notebooks implementing core ML algorithms with evaluations and plots.

## Structure

- `notebooks/` — experiments and notes.
- `data/` — local datasets (kept out of git by default).
- `requirements.txt` — minimal dependencies.

## Getting Started

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```
