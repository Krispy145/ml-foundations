# ML Foundations Notebooks

My personal notes and implementations while studying ML (e.g., Andrew Ngâ€™s courses).  
No course materials are redistributedâ€”just my own code and summaries.

## Structure

- `notebooks/` â€” experiments and notes.
- `data/` â€” local datasets (kept out of git by default).
- `requirements.txt` â€” minimal dependencies.

## Getting Started

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```
