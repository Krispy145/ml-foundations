## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Krispy145/ml-foundations.git
cd ml-foundations
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run notebook tests
jupyter nbconvert --execute --to notebook notebooks/*.ipynb
```

- Notebook execution → verify all cells run successfully
- Data validation → check data loading and processing
- Visualization → ensure plots render correctly
